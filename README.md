  ## Description

This is a backend e-commerce inventory management system application that uses Node.js, Sequelize, MySQL, and customised API calls to handle a company's merchandise.


  ## Challenges

Route configuration.


## User Story

As the manager of an online retailer, I NEED a back end for my website that utilises the most recent technology so that my business can compete with other e-commerce businesses.

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
```

  ## Installation
The associated packages must all be enabled by running npm instal before the application can run. The user must then run "node.seeds.index.js" in order to seed the database after creating the schema for the "ecommerce db" database. Run "node.server.js" to launch the server after that. The next step is to use Insomnia to send full CRUD commands for "categories," "products," and "tags" (i.e., POST, PUT, GET, and DELETE).
  ## Usage
   Backend system to manage inventory for an e-commerce site.
